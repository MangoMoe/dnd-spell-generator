Using Recurrent Neural Nets to generate DnD spells

## TODO

Scrape [this](https://www.dnd-spells.com/spells) site and use its text with a character-by-character RNN (Perhaps the one [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)) to generate new (and hopefully valid, though probably not balanced) spells. Once that is working see if you can somehow add a balance term to the loss to make balanced spells.

Heck maybe even use this to create new classes or subclasses or stat blocks, let your imagination go wild!
